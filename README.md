SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landing prediction

The rocket Falcon 9, developed by SpaceX, is the first orbital class rocket capable of reflight. It is composed by two-stage and the capability of reflight means it is possible to reuse their first-stage in safety. Because of this possibility of reuse of expensive parts of the rocket, the cost of a launch is diminished. The goal is to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The possibility to determine if the first stage will land implies in the possibility to determine of the cost of a launch, in such a way that an alternate company could use this information to compete with SpaceX to launch a rocket and “win the space race”.
